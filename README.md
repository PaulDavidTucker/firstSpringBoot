# First spring boot project

This application serves as a learning opportunity to finally understand how backend development works and how the spring framework operates.

So far I've learnt that using h2 is a real pain, JPA allows for mapping of entities for columns within tables just like SQL, controllers are used for creating endpoints etc, and altering the response actually returned when retreiving the data. 

A DTO is used to specify what information is transferred. 

Help me this project is a disaster

### Starting the project

1. Clone the project
2. Navigate to the main method and run the java file. (either compile it from CLI or use an IDE)
3. Go to localhost:8080 and call the various endpoints.
